			<div class="resume_item">
				<h3 class="job_title">Engineering Manager</h3>
				<div class="organization"><a href="https://www.policygenius.com">Policygenius</a></div>
				<div class="organization_dates">September 2021 - Present</div>
				<p>At Policygenius I manage two teams:</p>
					<p>Content/Lead Generation - responsible for the public <a href="https://policygenius.com">policygenius.com</a> content site and consumer education in
					our funnels (four engineers)<br/>
					Life Consumer - responsible for our life insurance sales funnel (five engineers)
				</p>
				<p>As a manager of multiple teams, I don't touch code very often, and if I do it's never on the critical path. My primary
					responsibilities include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Working with my teams to set and achieve technical goals every quarter based on the impact they will have
						on the business</li>
					<li>Partnering with Product Managers to identify leads for upcoming projects</li>
					<li>Aligning with the scrum lead for each team to ensure the teams are effective and meeting their goals</li>
					<li>Coaching individual contributors engineers in their continued growth through occasional code review or
						pairing, as well as providing feedback in 1:1s on how they can improve</li>
					<li>Coaching a rising manager on the above skills</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I guide my teams to prioritize the external user experience first, via performance (measured by Core Web
					Vitals/Lighthouse scores) and accessibility. Once we've planned to optimize for the user, then we can focus on
					internal users and then finally the developer experience to ensure we're being efficient.</p>

				<p>As the accountable engineer for our design system, I partner with design leads to ensure our component
					library is being built using functional components that are accessible and fast, while keeping an eye on where
					the web platform is heading in the future. </p>
				<p>Some accomplishments include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Due to architectrual changes my team spearheaded, Google now indexes new stories on the content site in one day rather than three.</li>
					<li>Total Blocking Time on the content site reduced by 50%</li>
					<li>After identifying a connection between funnel page speed and SEO, I led the charge on an engineering-wide culture shift to ensure we build for performance</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Tech stack: React, Contentful, Gatsby/Gatsby Cloud, GraphQL, SpeedCurve, DataDog RUM, Jest/React Testing Library,
					Cypress, BuildKite, Storybook

				<div class="organization"><a href="https://squarefoot.com">SquareFoot</a></div>
				<div class="organization_dates">February 2020 - September 2021</div>
				<p>
					SquareFoot is a commercial real estate brokerage. I led the team of 4 engineers resposible for the front-end of their client acquisition platform, which was used for showing listings to potential clients, onboarding them into our sales flow, and then facilitating the broker/client search experience.
				</p>
				<p>Some significant accomplishments include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Leading my team in working on the quarterly key result of improving mobile Lighthouse scores for key SEO pages from in the
						20's to 70's</li>
					<li>Proposing and driving a major upgrade on the web application's foundation and development workflow, which
						had core dependencies many years out of date (e.g. Node.js v6 when v13 was the most recent). From there, I
						championed migrating the main SEO pages to Next.JS, resulting in Lighthouse scores in the 90's, and improved
						rankings on Google Search.</li>
					<li>Spearheaded a successful transition of the team project management workflow. This was driven by a need
						for better asynchronous communications on a distributed team and to reduce time spent in planning meetings,
						while ensuring predictable project delivery.</li>

					I led a team of 6 web and devops engineers across North America and Germany, building projects to support Mozilla's mission of improving internet health. I worked closely with the design manager, product manager, and digital director to improve the Foundation's main site at foundation.mozilla.org. The design and engineering teams also functioned as a service organization internally. I partnered with the leaders of other teams to identify the best way for us to address their needs while pushing forward on our team's internal road map. I worked with my team to identify workflow challenges, improve their skills, and foster best software development practices while keeping us moving forward. Finally, as both the engineering lead and most senior technical manager in the org, I ensured organizational technology decisions were made prudently with an eye on long term impact and cost.

				<h2>Significant Projects</h2>
				<div class="significant-project">
					<h3>Policygenius Content Site Improvements</h3>
					<p>Upon joining Policygenius to lead the Content Engineering team, I realized that the most clear element of my team's contributions toward business goals that fell entirely under our control was visitors' experience as measured via Core Web Vitals. These are known to have an impact on SEO, so I began coach my team in their regular product-driven work to improve performance wherever possible. Over the course of a year, we:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Created a vision for the team going forward, from which we built our technical plan</li>
						<li>Started collecting data on site performance with and without 3rd party scripts to monitor for changes under our control</li>
						<li>Migrated to Gatsby Cloud so that we could have efficient single-page content updates rather than a homespun approach that caused React to thrash on render and slow down site indexing</li>
						<li>Reduced TBT by over 50% with the continued migration of CSS-in-JS components to use CSS Modules</li>
						<li>Began improving performance of applications beyond the content site after the realization that non-indexed pages still have an influence on SEO</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="significant-project">
					<h3>SquareFoot Next.JS migration</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Recognized an opportunity to improve web performance, increase developer effectiveness, and wrangle technical debt by moving from bespoke webpack configuration to standard Next.JS config</li>
						<li>Led the team in improving lighthouse scores from 20's to 70's, right as Google Page Experience search algorithm update went live</li>
						<li>Improved team's ability to work with a product manager on another continent via review applications</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="significant_project">
				<h3>Mozilla Donations platform</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Facilitated relationship with external contractors hired to rebuild our donations platform, which brings in millions of dollars per year.</li>
						<li>Acted as lead internal decision-maker for technology and implementation related details.</li>
						<li>Leveraged organizational and technological familiarity to ensure donor pipeline is optimized and collecting the right data to analyze for future improvement, while adhering to mission-driven privacy practices.</li>

						<li>Led team to significantly reduce challenges in reviewing/testing changes, improve deployment process, and modularize front-end</li>
						<li>Listened to the pulse of the organization to understand and direct feature development, meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders simultaneously</li>
